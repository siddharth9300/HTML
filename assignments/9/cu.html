        </h1><br>
        <p>The control unit as the name suggests is the controller of all the activities/tasks and operations. All this is
            performed inside the computer.</p><br>
            <p>The memory unit sends a set of instructions to the control unit. Then the control unit in turn converts those
                instructions. After that these instructions are converted to control signals. <br><br>These control signals help
                in prioritizing and scheduling the activities. Thus, the control unit coordinates the tasks inside the computer
                in sync with the input and output units.<br><br></p>

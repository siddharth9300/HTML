    <h1>CPU – Central Processing Unit
    </h1><br>
    <p>Central Processing Unit or the CPU, is the brain of the computer. It works the same way a human brain works. As
        the brain controls all human activities, the CPU too controls all tasks.</p><br>
    <p>Moreover, the CPU conducts all the arithmetical and logical operations in the computer.</p><br>
    <p>Now the CPU comprises of two units, namely – ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and CU (Control Unit). Both of these
        units work in sync. The CPU processes the data as a whole.</p><br>
    <p>Let us see what particular tasks are assigned to both units.</p>

        <h1>Arithmetic Logic Unit
        </h1><br>
        <p>The Arithmetic Logic Unit is made of two terms, arithmetic and logic. There are two major functions that this
            unit performs.</p><br>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Data inserted through the input unit into the primary memory. Performs the basic arithmetical operation on
                    it. Like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It performs all sorts of calculations required
                    on the data. Then sends back data to the storage.</li>
                    <li>The unit is also responsible for performing logical operations like, AND, OR, Equal to, Less than,
                        etc.&nbsp; In addition to this it conducts merging, sorting, and selection of the given data.<br><br></li>

        <h1>Memory Unit
        </h1><br>
        <p>All the data that has to be processed or has been processed is stored in the memory unit. The memory unit acts as
            a hub of all the data. It transmits it to the required part of the computer whenever necessary.</p>
            <p>The memory unit works in sync with the CPU. This helps in faster accessing and processing of the data. Thus,
                making tasks easier and faster. <br><br>There are two types of computer memory-</p>
                <ol>
        <li><strong>Primary memory</strong> – This type of memory cannot store a vast amount of data. Therefore, it is
            only used to store recent data. The data stored in this is temporary. It can get erased once the power is
            switched off. Therefore, is also called temporary memory or the main memory. <br><br>RAM stands for Random
            Access Memory. It is an example of primary memory. This memory is directly accessible by the CPU. It is used
            for reading and writing purposes. For data to be processed, it has to be first transferred to the RAM and
            then to the CPU.<br><br></li>
            <li><strong>Secondary memory</strong> – As explained above, the primary memory stores temporary data. Thus it
                cannot be accessed in the future. For permanent storage purposes,secondary memory is used. It is also called the permanent memory or the
            auxiliary memory. The hard disk is an example of secondary memory. Even in a power failure data does not get
            erased easily.<br><br></li>
        </ol>

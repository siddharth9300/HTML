        <h1>Output
        </h1><br>
        <p>There is nothing to be amazed by what the output unit is used for. All the
            information sent to the computer once processed is received by the user through the output unit. Devices like
            printers, monitors, projector, etc. all come under the output unit.</p><br>
            <p>The output unit displays the data either in the form of a soft copy or hard copy. The printer is for the hard
                copy. The monitor is for the display. The output unit accepts the data in binary form from the computer. It then
                converts it into a readable form for the user.<br><br></p>
